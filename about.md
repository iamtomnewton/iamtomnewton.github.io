I am a product and design leader with over a decade of agency and in-house experience. I manage and scale design teams while helping to define user-centred business strategies and understand how and where design can provide measurable long-term user and business value. I am currently Head of Design at [Lunar](https://www.lunar.app/en/personal) in Denmark.

I have a background in development and lead from a cross-discipline mentality, ensuring the product is designed and built harmoniously to reduce waste and provide value with measurable success.

I always strive to find the correct answer to optimise the customer experience through workshops, design sprints and rapid prototyping to validate ideas in the hands of real people.
