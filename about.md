Iâ€™m a highly-motivated design leader with experience leading cross discipline teams and projects from brief to live product across various web and app platforms. Located in Manchester, I'm currently the Lead UX Designer for the cars arm of Booking.com [(Rental Cars)](https://www.rentalcars.com/en/) core product team as well as being on the fantastic [CSSDA](http://www.cssdesignawards.com/) judging panel.

I have a background in development and lead from a cross discipline mentality, ensuring the product is designed and built harmoniously to reduce waste and provide value with measurable success.

I always strive to find the correct answer to optimise the customer experience through workshops, design sprints and rapid prototyping to validate ideas in the hands of real people.
