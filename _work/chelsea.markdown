Chelsea Football Club wanted to improve the match day experience for their Hospitality guests by creating a unique, premium and exclusive app that provides important content to users in a convenient and hassle free way.
The app takes advantage of knowing that the user will be at Chelsea's home ground (Stamford Bridge) to provide a contextual experience by displaying relevant information based on the ticket type, time and also the users location throughout the day.

Before the game the app displays a countdown to the fixture and widgets showing a weather forecast, travel information and relevant news articles.
When the user has arrived at the ground, the app uses GPS and wifi signals to determine this information and changes the widgets to display the specific users match day itinerary, food / wine menus and a full hospitality guide featuring information on staff members, an FAQ and other relevant information.

Once the game has kicked off, the app changes into a live timeline which displays commentary and match events along with team lineups (including player profiles) and match statistics. During half-time the app shows special offers and scores from other games in the same league or competition.
After the game the app shows the final score and goal scorers with offers, a live photo gallery from the game, news and travel information on how to get home.

Below is a small selection of key screens. The full app is available for download from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chelsea-fc-hospitality/id751451886?mt=8) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chelseafc.hospitality&hl=en_GB).
