[Manolo Blahnik](https://www.manoloblahnik.com) shoes have traditionally been sold in a small number of specifically chosen retail boutiques across the world, but have never officially been available online.

While at Somewhat_ we were approached by Manolo Blahnik to create an online boutique as handcrafted and unique as their physical locations. The brief was to create a responsive e-commerce site that primarily focused on the shoes themselves, “a website that’s not a website”.

We worked closely with Manolo Blahnik’s team and the man himself to craft the identity of the site based on the simple brief. The site took shape with a mobile first approach to make sure that each page was meticulously thought out and stripped back to it’s bare essentials, giving the shoes the focus they deserve.
Through a combination of minimal UI solutions, fantastic custom photography and clever use of technology we were able to craft a site that was not only incredibly simple to use but that also creates an immersive experience, delivering the user in to the world of Manolo Blahnik shoes.
